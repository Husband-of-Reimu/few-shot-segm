# Implementation of few shot semantic segmentation in Keras

This repository includes several few-shot semantic segmentation 
frameworks in Keras and try to reproduce the results and test for the 
stablity of their convergence.

Here are the models and frameworks that we will try to include:

- [OSLSM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03410.pdf)
- [co-FCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07373.pdf)
- [SG-one](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.09091.pdf)
- [PrototypeNet](http://bmvc2018.org/contents/papers/0255.pdf)

## TODO list:
- finish implementation
- try to add the weight hashing layer
